## INTRODUCTION:

### Optimizing Jarvis March: A Parallel vs. Serial Approach:

Jarvis March, also known as the Gift-Wrapping algorithm, efficiently computes the convex hull of a set of points in a plane. This project compares the efficiencies of parallel and serial implementations of Jarvis March, analyzing execution times, scalability, and resource utilization. It aims to highlight the advantages and challenges in parallelizing the algorithm for computational geometry tasks.

### Binary Search Tree: A Parallel vs. Serial Approach:

A binary search tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure pivotal for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. This study evaluates performance differences between traditional serial BST structures and their parallelized counterparts using OpenMP and MPI. Factors like search times, scalability, and resource utilization are examined, providing insights into optimizing data structure management in parallel computing.
